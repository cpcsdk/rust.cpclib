; Action: Resets the sound manager by clearing the sound queues and abandoning any current sounds
; Entry: No entry conditions
; Exit: AF, BC, DE and HL are corrupt, and all others are preserved
SOUND_RESET equ #BCA7

; Action: Adds a sound to the sound queue of a channel
; Entry: HL contains the address of a series of bytes which define the sound and are stored in the central 32K of RAM
; Exit: If the sound was successfully added to the queue, then Carry is true and HL is corrupt; if one of the sound queues was full, then Carry is false and HL is preserved; in either case, A, BC, DE, IX and the other flags are corrupt, and all others are preserved
; Notes: The bytes required to define the sound are as followsbyte 0 - channel status bytebyte 1 - volume envelope to usebyte 2 - tone envelope to usebytes 3&4 - tone periodbyte 5 - noise periodbyte 6 - start volumebytes 7&8 - duration of the sound, or envelope repeat count
SOUND_QUEUE equ #BCAA

; Action: Gets the status of a sound channel
; Entry: A contains the channel to test - for channel A, bit 0 set; for channel B, bit 1 set; for channel C, bit 2 set
; Exit: A contains the channel status, BC, DE, HL and flags are corrupt, and all others are preserved
; Notes: The channel status returned is bit significant, as followsbits 0 to 2 - the number of free spaces in the sound queuebit 3 - trying to rendezvous with channel Abit 4 - trying to rendezvous with channel Bbit 5 - trying to rendezvous with channel Cbit 6 - holding the channelbit 7 - producing a sound
SOUND_CHECK equ #BCAD

; Action: Sets up an event which will be activated when a space occurs in a sound queue
; Entry: A contains the channel to set the event up for (see SOUND CHECK for the bit values this can take), and HL holds the address of the event block
; Exit: AF, BC, DE and HL are corrupt, and all other registers are preserved
; Notes: The event block must be initialised by KL INIT EVENT and is disarmed when the event itself is run
SOUND_ARM_EVENT equ #BCB0

; Action: Allows the playing of sounds on specific channels that had been stopped by SOUND HOLD
; Entry: A contains the sound channels to be released (see SOUND CHECK for the bit values this can take)
; Exit: AF, BC, DE, HL and IX are corrupt, and all others are preserved
SOUND_RELEASE equ #BCB3

; Action: Immediately stops all sound output (on all channels)
; Entry: No entry conditions
; Exit: If a sound was being made, then Carry is true; if no sound was being made, then Carry is false; in all cases, A, BC, HL and other flags are corrupt, and all others are preserved
; Notes: When the sounds are restarted, they will begin from exactly the same place that they were stopped
SOUND_HOLD equ #BCB6

; Action: Restarts all sound output (on all channels)
; Entry: No entry conditions
; Exit: AF, BC, DE and IX are corrupt, and all others are preserved
SOUND_CONTINUE equ #BCB9

; Action: Sets up avolume envelope
; Entry: A holds an envelope number (from 1 to 15), HL holds the address of a block of data for the envelope
; Exit: If it was set up properly, Carry is true, HL holds the data block address + 16, A and BC are corrupt; if the envelope number is invalid, then Carry is false, and A, B and HL are preserved; in either case, DE and the other flags are corrupt, and all other registers are preserved
; Notes: All the rules of enevelopes in BASIC also apply; the block of the data for the envelope is set up as followsbyte 0 - number of sections in the envelopebytes 1 to 3 - first section of the envelopebytes 4 to 6 - second section of the envelopebytes 7 to 9 - third section of the envelopebytes 10 to 12 - fourth section of the envelopebytes 13 to 15 - fifth section of the envelopeEach section of the envelope has three bytes set out as followsbyte 0 - step count (with bit 7 set)byte 1 - step sizebyte 2 - pause time or if it is a hardware envelope, then each section takes the following formbyte 0 - envelope shape (with bit 7 not set)bytes 1 and 2 - envelope periodSee also SOUND TONE ENVELOPE below
SOUND_AMPL_ENVELOPE equ #BCBC

; Action: Sets up a tone envelope
; Entry: A holds an envelope number (from 1 to 15), HL holds the address of a block of data for the envelope
; Exit: If it was set up properly, Carry is true, HL holds the data block address + 16, A and BC are corrupt; ยก if the envelope number is invalid, then Carry is false, and A, B and HL are preserved; in either case, DE and the other flags are corrupt, and all other registers are preserved
; Notes: All the rules of envelopes in BASIC also apply; the block of the data for the envelope is set up as followsbyte 0 - number of sections in the envelopebytes 1 to 3 - first section of the envelopebytes 4 to 6 - second section of the envelopebytes 7 to 9 - third section of the envelopebytes 10 to 12 - fourth section of the envelopebytes 13 to 15 - fifth section of the envelopeEach section of the envelope has three bytes set out as followsbyte 0 - step countbyte 1 - step sizebyte 2 - pause timeSee also SOUND AMPL ENVELOPE above
SOUND_TONE_ENVELOPE equ #BCBF

; Action: Gets the address of the data block associated with a volume envelope
; Entry: A contains an envelope number (from 1 to 15)
; Exit: If it was found, then Carry is true, HL holds the data block's address, and BC holds its length; if the envelope number is invalid, then Carry is false, HL is corrupt and BC is preserved; in both cases, A and the other flags are corrupt, and all others are preserved
SOUND_A_ADDRESS equ #BCC2
