I had finaly dump my Amstrad 6128 Danish firmware rom.


The Files
----------

1. 6128-BasicDanish.rom
1. 6128-LowerDanish.rom
2. 6130-LowerDanish z key Corrected.rom



6128-LowerDanish.rom is the original rom but for some reason the z key
was moved one pixel up, therefore i had made a rom where i had corrected
the faulty z and name it "6130-LowerDanish z key Corrected.rom"


I don't think there are any difference between the Danish and English basic ROM
